# Dreadnought

Experimental native macOS WebAPI client for qBittorrent, written in Swift and built using SwiftUI.

Dreadnought is compatible qBittorrent 5.0 or newer.

## Downloads

Pre-built application bundles can be downloaded from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Hamuko/Dreadnought/releases/).

Note that the app bundles are not signed and notarised (as I'm currently not paying Apple for the privilege), so you'll need to [disable Gatekeeper](https://disable-gatekeeper.github.io) for Dreadnought.
